# hello-world
One code at a time
I am that tech girl that loves reading, sharing and interacting on everything technology but finds it tasking to write a line of code. I am making this commit here today so I am committed and dedicated to actually writing codes and putting my ideas to live so help me God.
This is a new change to my code and life
